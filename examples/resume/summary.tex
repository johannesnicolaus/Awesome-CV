I am a 2nd year PhD student at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology at the Genomics and Regulatory Systems Unit. I am currently working to investigate the epigenetic basis of transcriptional regulation in the pelagic tunicate \emph{Oikopleura dioica}. Previously, I have used single-cell omics and fluorescence imaging analysis to investigate NF‑κB mediated transcriptional regulation in B cell. I am familiar with R, ImageJ macro and bash programming languages for image processing and analysis of multi‑omics data. I also have experience with basic molecular biology experiments such as mammalian and avian cell culture, RNA‑FISH, molecular cloning, genome editing and qPCR. Being highly adaptable and proactive, I am keen and can quickly grasp new concepts that can be applied to my current and future research.
