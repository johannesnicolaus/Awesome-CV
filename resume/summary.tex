I am currently a 2nd year MSc student in the Graduate School of Science, Osaka University researching about the NF-ÎºB signal transduction system in B cell through fluorescence imaging, single-cell trancriptomics and functional omics analysis (scATAC-seq, scRNA-seq). I am familiar with R, ImageJ macro and bash programming language for image processing and analysis of multi-omics data. Furthermore, I also have experience with basic molecular biology experiments such as mammalian and avian cell culture, RNA-FISH, molecular cloning and qPCR. I am keen on learning new skills and techniques that I can apply to my current and future research. Finally, I am an adaptable and flexible person that can quickly grasp new concepts to efficiently complete given targets.
